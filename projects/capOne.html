        <h2>Sprint Capacity Tracker</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            During my second year at university, we had to participate in a group project. After meeting our randomly assigned groups, we had to decide which projects we wanted to apply for including whether we wanted to work with an 
            internal sponsor or and external sponsor. The project we selected and got the chance to work on was a Sprint Capacity Tracker with Capital One.
        </p>
        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>
            We developed a complete system formed of a database running on AWS, a backend written in java and a frontend developed in react.js. The end result was a web application that communicated throughout all the parts of the system.
            In order to communicate wbetween the backend and the database we used the Hibernate frame work to allow us to map the database to an object oriented language such as java.
            In the back end we used the RESTful API and JSON files to use HTTP request to communicate with the front end, as well as the Spring Boot framework inorder to create a micro service approach to the solution. In the front end we used many APIs
            in order to display the data in the useful formats. The most used was the react-table-filter API as we found tables were very useful to display the data efficiently.
