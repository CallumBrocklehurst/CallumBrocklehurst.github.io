                    <p>After being introduced to cloud concepts during my internship, I decided to further my knowledge once returning to the workplace. In December 2022 I passed my AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner qualification and I am currently working towards my AWS Solutions Archtect. </p>

					<p>I graduated from The University of Nottingham with a first class master degree in Computer Science. During my time studying I compelted two dissertations, one focused on software enginerering and the other around research. The software based project involved writing a GUI based enclosure design system to allow researchers from the vet schoool to explore how elephants react to their environment. This involved using agent based modelling in order to simulate the animals. In my final year I wrote an academic paper investigating Resistance to Cybersecurity Attacks in a Novel Network for Autonomous Vehicles. This was published in the Journal of Sensor and Actuator Networks.</p>

                    <p>In 2018 I was awarded the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award. In order to get the award, I had to participate in a series of activities to cover a range of categories. For the repective categories I chose: Volunteering - Scout Leader, Physical - Squash, Skill - Guitar, Residential - Headstart Course on Robotics and Autonomous Systems and for the Expediditon section I completed it on foot for five days in the Lake District.  </p>
